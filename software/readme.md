# üíß POC Urine Dipstick Analyzer


This repository contains the **hardware firmware** and **Python GUI** for a **portable point-of-care urinalysis device**. The system provides continuous, on-demand analysis of urine using **dipstick-based colorimetric sensing** and delivers real-time insights through a connected mobile interface.

---

## üß† System Overview

The POC device is built around two core modules:

1. üßæ **On-Demand Dipstick Dispenser**  
2. üß™ **Automated Colorimetric Analyzer**

The user pulls a dipstick (like a ticket), dips it into a urine sample, and reinserts it into the device. The system captures RGB color data, processes it, and transmits results via Bluetooth or serial connection.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### `firmware.ino`
- **Platform:** Arduino (ESP32)
- **Functions:**
  - Controls motors and sensors
  - Reads color from TCS34725
  - Listens to serial commands from GUI
  - Sends RGB readings to host

### `gui.py`
- **Platform:** Python 3.x
- **Dependencies:** `pyserial`, `matplotlib`, `tkinter`
- **Functions:**
  - Connects to the ESP32 via serial
  - Sends commands for dispensing and scanning
  - Plots and stores RGB sensor data in real-time

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

### 1. Flash Firmware
Upload `firmware.ino` to an ESP32 board using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

### 2. Launch GUI

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pyserial matplotlib

### 3. Run the GUI:
```bash
python gui.py


Connect your ESP32 via USB and choose the correct serial port from the interface.
